= Introduction

This project is about building a 15cm cube that can balance on one of its edgesâ€”or even on
one of its corners. The cube is equipped with reaction wheels that it uses to fight off any forces
trying to bring it down, the same way Philippe Petit used his stick.
The reaction wheels have a significant moment of inertia, enough so that the universe wants to cancle
any change in angular momentum, by rotating the cube in the oposite way...

The internal logic and the physical output of our system needs to be joined together by circuitry;
a way to translate our calculations for balance onto the motors themselves. Our circuitry has
three main responsibilites; input -> calculate -> output. Our input will be in form of sensordata
indicating our cubes current angle, and a wanted state (do we want to balance? on which edge? so
on). Our calculations will be about transforming our current input angles into a quantative action
for the motors to perform. The output will in turn be the adjustment of our motors to achieve
balance. High level, this will require accelerometers and gyroscopes as our input, a microcontroller
to perform the calculations, and motors to be adjusted for output. All this combined can be
reasonably packed into a few circuits that contain a few sensors, a microcontroller, and motordriver
capabililities.  This section of our documentation aims to provide context and reasoning behind our
main circuit choices, as well as give a general overview of all components, their role in Cubitron
specifically, and how they are interconnected to achieve a cohesive circuit with results.
The circuitry will consist of three different PCBs. Two PCBs are mounted on opposite corners of the
cube, containing an Inertial Measuremt Unit each. The last circuit will be mounted in the center of
the cube, containing our main logic, motors, battery charger, driver gates; essentially the rest of
our circuitry. Three BLDC motors that put motion to our flywheels are connected to our main circuit.
Additionally, three micro-servos are positioned for braking mechanism for each flywheel. Cables
between the main circuit, BLDC motors and sensor-PCBs will be of type PFC. They are a thin, compact
and convenient snap-on cable to work with. They came standard with our chosen motors, and influenced
the choice for the sensor PCBs. The micro-servo are cabled with individual insulated wires bundled
together. It is important to be specific with wire lengths, as loose wires may disurb moving parts
of the whole robot.
To gain context of our implementation, this subsection will outline every integrated circuit we
use, what their general purpose in a project is, and more specifically what their purpose is for
Cubitron.
Our microcontroller will be the ATSAME53J18A-MF, which is has a 32-bit ARM Cortex-4 processor. Our
main reasons for this microcontroller is the ceiling for calculations and peripherals. We expect
to make reasonably heavy calculations in the context of an embedded system, which the 32 bit system
with an in built Floating Point Unit is excellent for. Additionally, we need to connect two sensors
and six motors, which makes the pool of peripherals we need to support quite large. We also have
personal experience with the usage of these microcontrollers, with similar problem statements, and
were satisfied with the physical capabilities of our microcontroller.
The microcontroller has the most central and complicated role of the whole circuitry. It will be the
component responsible of combing the three main stages of our program runtime. The pipeline of Input
-> Calculate -> Output has the microcontroller as a major component in all of them. Our sensors
will both be sending their data through an I2C connection to our microcontroller. They will have
an assigned interrupt pin each, which opens for having our sensor data be as close to real time as
possible. From this sensor data, we need to calculate our current position in space, with regard to
our 3D orientation, and calculate again how far this is from our intended position, and what motor
actions we need to perform to get there. Lastly, our output stage will consist of sending that data
to our TMC controllers, and adjusting our motors physically.  The TMC4671, which will be detailed
later, needs a 25MHz clock signal to operate. This microcontroller has a Generic Clock Controller,
which can be configured to generate a steady 25MHz clock signal to each of the TMC4671 ICs. As you
can imagine, our microcontroller is hooked up to a of external components in our circuitry, which
is quite nice to have an overview over. Below is a table of the names of all external connections in
the perspective of our microcontroller schematics, the endpoint they are connected to, the pin and
pin type it is connected to, and a short description of its purpose:

We actually have two individual microcontrollers on this board, but the second one is intended for
programming our main microcontroller. If you looked at the pin table for the ATSAME53J18A-MF, we
have two entries with the endpoint "Programmer", which refers to this component. The programmer
equips a 32-bit ARM Cortex M0+ processor, and was chosen because of the close relation to the
microcontroller above, and being able to act as a bridge for programming and debugging the
Cortex-M4, with the firmware CMSIS-DAP. This explains the pins between the programmer and our
main Cortex-M4. CMSIS-DAP (Cortex Microcontroller Interface Standard) is an ARM standard for
the DAP (Debug Access Port) that provides an USB interface to allow debugging and programming
ARM Cortex-M microcontrollers. Our Cortex-M0 will have an USB-C interface through the physical
connector of our microcontroller, which will communicate with the device we are flashing
from (probably our computers). Furthermore, we can use DAP functionality for debugging and
flashing our controller. We can program the flash memory through our USB interface, debug
(stop execution, set breapoints, view memory, etc...) our programs.  Read more about CMSIS-DAP:

The TMC4671 allows for control of a BLDC motor, and will be tripled up for the control of three BLDC
motors in total. The benefit of this is being allowed to control the motors completely separated,
with no interference between the three. We will take use of supported field operated control (FOC),
which allows for very precise and energy efficient moving of the motors.  The TMC471 communicates
with our MCU using the SPI protocol. SPI fits our system well, as it allows our master (MCU) to
have several slaves (motors) on fewer lines. The TMC471 needs extensive input to ensure a precise
output. It takes in hall sensor data directly from its opposing BLDC motor, and reads current
sensors to regulate torque. Each of these signals are  We need to ensure our Digital Encoder/Hall
Sensor signals, which usually operates on 5V are regulated down to 3.3V, which the 4671 asks for.
As of right now, the digital encoders may be seen as redundant. Both the digital  encoders and hall
sensors are intended to provide the TMC4671 data about how our motors are positioned. Because of
our motor choice having in-built hall sensors, that will be the simpler approach. Adding digital
encoders in this implementation can be seen as overkill. We can add digital encoders on a second
iteration if the extra resolution is needed.

/* Agree? */
We have disconnected the BRAKE pin. The pin is not intended for braking the motors, but for
dissipating excess energy provided for the motors voltage feedback. Outside of scope for
now.  REF_R. REF_H, REF_L are pins intended to be driven HIGH if we can tell if the motors are
approaching the physical limits of motion. This is overkill for our project, as there are no real
scenarios wherein we would deem this necessary. Our motors only control a flywheel clockwise or
counter-clockwise. We wont ever be in a position where this is no more degrees we can spin in a
given direction physically.  The ENI (Enable Input)/ENO (Enable Output) pins are two separate pins
that co-operate. Enable Input essentially acts like a kill switch for the motor control in general.
If we  reach a bad state, we can drive ENI low, and the motors will chill out. ENO is an output pin,
which just reflects the state of ENI, and is intended for more self-reliant embedded systems. Again,
we control everything with SPI. Therefore we will have the ENI pin as a killswitch, while having
ENO disconnected. The STEP and DIR pins are not needed, as we will be communicating to the TMC4671
through SPI. STEP and DIR are for external motion controllers, like an FPGA steering the motors.
Lastly, we have a lot of PWM signals that we need to decide if we need or not. Let us go through the
unneeded ones first:  PWM_I is PWM input for steering the motor. We use SPI, and therefore do not
need this connected.  PWM_IDLE_H / PWM_IDLE_L are for setting idle states. We dont need any specific
idle states, because our cube will be flat on the ground when not in use, which does not require
a specific motor position/speed/torque etc. Therefore this will not be connected Both of the above
are PWM inputs in perspective of the TMC4671. The rest of the PWM signals are PWM outputs, which
will be going to our driver gates. These are essential for  motor operation, and is part of the core
functionality of the controller. Therefore we route these outputs to the driver gates, which will
in return drive the motors.  Lastly, we need to decide on whether we want debugging through SPI or
UART. /*TODO*/

We will in total have three separate circuits, wherein two of them will be dedicated to host a
single IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) each. The rationale for this is the positions we will mount
the sensors, to acquire the information about our orientation in order to stabilize the system at a
given angle. One IMU will be mounted on the corner which will be facing the ground during operation,
and the other IMU will be on the corner straight above the corner facing the ground, so they form
a straight line. We can then deduce the orientation and angle of the cube, in such a way that we
know our cube is balancing straight if $theta = pi / 2$ with respect to the ground, and $Delta theta
approx 0$.

The specific IC we will move forward is the ISM330DHXC, it hoists two separate sensors; a 3D
gyroscope and 3D accelerometer. The sensors are high accuracy and high performance, comfortable
to use and reliable. The team has had previous experience with the specific IMU, and have written
drivers for similar purposes that can be partially reused.   It communicates with either I2C or
SPI, wherein we decided I2C is best for us. We want to make the internals as cable and hassle free
as possible. I2C lets us only need to route five signals through a PFC cable, which will decrease
the size of the female end of the connectors, the PCBs, and the cable itself. We are sacrifizing a
pin on the main microcontroller to route one Serialized Data signal to each microcontroller, with
no I2C switch. The respective are instead both pulled high and communicated with on respective
lines.  Because the IMU itself has such few pins, we can include the whole table and the intended
pin connections:

The braking system requires one micro-servo for each flywheel to be able to stop their momentum as close to instant as possible. The micro-servos are a part of a
larger mechanical brake functioning closely to a the way a bike-brake works. From a circuitry perspective, the braking system is quite simple, and only requires pins on
the MCU for control, and headers to connect the motors themselves to. /* Find specific model */

Our OLED screen is added for personalization and options for communicating interesting internal
states. The GROVE OLED SSD1306 is a small OLED display with a 64x48 resolution. It is just a fun
addition to our circuit, and requires only I2C pins for communication. We will be using the U8G2
library for displaying and communicating easily through I2C.
